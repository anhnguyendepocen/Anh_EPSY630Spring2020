# Introduction

A little about me:

* Principal Investigator for a Department of Education Grant (part of their FIPSE First in the World program) to develop a Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills ([www.DAACS.net](http://www.daacs.net))  at [Excelsior College](http://excelsior.edu)
* Research Data Associate at Cornell University
* Adjunct Associate Professor at CUNY in the Master's of Data Science program
* Authored over a dozen R packages including:
	* [likert](http://github.com/jbryer/likert)
	* [sqlutils](http://github.com/jbryer/sqlutils)
	* [timeline](http://github.com/jbryer/timeline)
* Specialize in propensity score methods. Three new methods/R packages developed include:
	* [multilevelPSA](http://github.com/jbryer/multilevelPSA)
	* [TriMatch](http://github.com/jbryer/TriMatch)
	* [PSAboot](http://github.com/jbryer/PSAboot)

# Your turn

* Name?
* Program?
* What statistics courses have you already taken?
* What do you hope to get from this class?
* What is something interesting about yourself we would otherwise not know?

# Syllabus

Syllabus and course materials are here: [https://epsy630.bryer.org](https://epsy630.bryer.org)

The site is built using the [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R package and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/jbryer/EPSY630Spring2020). Each page of the site has a "Improve this page" link at the bottom right, use that to start a pull request on Github.

# The DATA606 R Package

The package can be installed from Github using the `devtools` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('jbryer/DATA606')
```

Download the `Setup.R` script here: https://github.com/jbryer/EPSY887Fall2019/blob/master/R/Setup.R

# Class Structure

Please bring your laptop with R and Rstudio installed. The classes will be structured like workshops where there will be a combination of lecture and activites. 

In the second half of the class I would like to allocate class time to work on your projects you will be presented.

# First Lab / Assignment

Install R and Rstudio.

Run the setup script: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/EPSY887-Fall2019/master/R/Setup.R
Complete Lab 1. Use the following commands to get started:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
DATA606::startLab('Lab1')
```
