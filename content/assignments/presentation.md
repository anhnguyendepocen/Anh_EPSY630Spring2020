The purpose of the data project is for you to conduct a reproducible analysis with a data set of your choosing. There are two components to the project, the proposal, which will be graded on a pass/fail basis, and the final presentation. Suggestions for possible data sources are included below, however you are free to use data not listed below. The only requirement is that you are allowed to share the data.

* Describe the method of data collection.
* What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?
* Data Source: If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.
* Response: What is the response (dependent) variable, and what type is it (quantitative/qualitative)?
* Explanatory: What is the explanatory (independent) variable(s), and what type is it (quantitative/qualitative)?
* What statistical method do you plan to use? For example, t-test, ANOVA, regression, chi-squared.
